# POS-WebApp
This is my first full stack web app that has been built from scratch. The back end is written in Node.js using Express.js and MongoDB.

This app is a basic example of a Point of Sales (POS) software utilising an example database provided by MongoDB which was pre-populated with example transactions. I built my app around this database, while also adding my own parts to the database to expand the functionality of my web app.
